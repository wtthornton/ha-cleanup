# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Core MVP Phase 1
> Created: 2024-12-20

## Overview

Deliver a functional mobile-first interface for viewing historical Home Assistant data stored in InfluxDB, enabling users to browse events, view basic charts, and access the application from mobile devices. This phase establishes the foundation for data visualization and analysis capabilities.

## User Stories

### Mobile-First Data Access

As a Home Assistant user, I want to access my historical smart home data from my mobile device, so that I can quickly review system performance and events while on the go. I should be able to navigate the interface easily with touch gestures and view data in a responsive layout that adapts to my screen size.

### Event Data Exploration

As a smart home enthusiast, I want to browse through my Home Assistant events chronologically with basic filtering options, so that I can identify patterns and understand what's happening in my system. I need to see event timestamps, entity names, and state changes in an organized, searchable format.

### Basic Data Visualization

As a data-conscious user, I want to view simple line charts for my sensor data over time, so that I can spot trends and anomalies in my smart home performance. The charts should be interactive enough to zoom and pan, but simple enough to load quickly on mobile devices.

## Spec Scope

1. **Project Setup** - Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite and Tailwind CSS
2. **Basic UI Framework** - Create responsive layout with mobile-first design principles
3. **Data Connection** - Connect to existing InfluxDB from ha-ingestor deployment
4. **Event Browser** - Display Home Assistant events with basic filtering and search
5. **Simple Charts** - Basic line charts for sensor data visualization with mobile-friendly interactions
6. **Mobile Navigation** - Touch-friendly navigation and responsive design for all screen sizes
7. **Mock Data Mode** - Enable development with sample data for rapid iteration and testing

## Out of Scope

- Advanced analytics and pattern recognition
- Suggestion generation and approval workflows
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Real-time data streaming and live updates
- Complex data aggregation and reporting
- Export functionality and data downloads
- Custom dashboard configurations
- Performance optimization beyond basic functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional React web application that can be deployed alongside ha-ingestor and accessed from mobile devices
2. An event browser that displays Home Assistant events from InfluxDB with basic filtering and search capabilities
3. Basic line chart visualizations for sensor data that are responsive and mobile-friendly
