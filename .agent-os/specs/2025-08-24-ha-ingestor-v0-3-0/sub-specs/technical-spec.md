# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-24-ha-ingestor-v0-3-0/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Enhanced Data Collection
- Implement extended event capture for state changes, automation triggers, service calls, device discovery, integration health, and user interactions
- Add enhanced metadata collection including device capabilities, integration versions, network topology, performance timing, error context, and user action history
- Ensure event capture maintains sub-100ms processing latency
- Support capture of 10,000+ events per second

### Data Quality & Validation
- Implement schema validation for all incoming data using Pydantic models
- Add data type checking and conversion with automatic format standardization
- Implement required field validation and duplicate detection
- Create comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation and retry mechanisms
- Add data corruption detection and automatic repair capabilities where possible

### Context Enrichment
- Implement temporal context enrichment including event timing, timezone handling, seasonal patterns, and peak usage detection
- Add spatial context with device location, room mapping, environmental context, and proximity relationships
- Create relationship mapping for device dependencies, integration relationships, and automation dependencies
- Implement circular dependency detection and resource sharing pattern analysis

### Data Export APIs
- Create REST API endpoints for real-time streaming, historical queries, and aggregated data access
- Implement WebSocket streaming with subscription management, rate limiting, and connection health monitoring
- Support multiple export formats: JSON, CSV, Parquet, Protocol Buffers, Avro
- Ensure API response times under 100ms for 95% of requests

### Integration Interfaces
- Implement MQTT publishing for real-time data distribution
- Add HTTP webhooks for event notifications
- Create GraphQL API for flexible data queries
- Support gRPC for high-performance data access
- Maintain WebSocket for bidirectional communication
