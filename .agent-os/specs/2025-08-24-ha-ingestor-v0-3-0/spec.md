> Spec: HA-Ingestor v0.3.0 - Enhanced Data Ingestion & Preparation Layer
> Created: 2025-08-24

## Overview

Enhance HA-Ingestor to provide clean, structured, and enriched data for downstream systems by improving data collection, validation, enrichment, and export capabilities while maintaining focus on core ingestion responsibilities.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Data Collection

As a **data engineer**, I want comprehensive event capture with full context and metadata, so that downstream analytics systems have complete and accurate data for analysis and insights.

**Detailed Workflow**: The system will capture extended event types including state changes, automation triggers, service calls, device discovery, integration health, and user interactions. Each event will include enhanced metadata such as device capabilities, integration versions, network topology, performance timing, error context, and user action history.

### Data Quality & Validation

As a **system administrator**, I want robust data validation and error handling, so that data integrity is maintained and processing errors are gracefully handled with comprehensive logging and recovery mechanisms.

**Detailed Workflow**: All incoming data will undergo schema validation, data type checking, required field validation, format standardization, and duplicate detection. The system will implement graceful degradation on data errors, comprehensive error logging, retry mechanisms, data corruption detection, and automatic data repair where possible.

### Data Export & Integration

As a **developer**, I want multiple data export formats and integration protocols, so that other systems can easily consume and integrate with HA-Ingestor data for building advanced features like analytics, ML, and optimization engines.

**Detailed Workflow**: The system will provide REST API endpoints for real-time streaming, historical queries, and aggregated data access. WebSocket streaming will enable live event streaming with subscription management and rate limiting. Integration protocols will include MQTT publishing, HTTP webhooks, GraphQL API, gRPC, and multiple data formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers, Avro, Parquet).

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Data Collection** - Implement comprehensive event capture with extended event types and enhanced metadata collection
2. **Data Quality & Validation** - Add robust input validation, error handling, and recovery mechanisms for data integrity
3. **Context Enrichment** - Implement temporal and spatial context enrichment with relationship mapping
4. **Data Export APIs** - Create REST API endpoints and WebSocket streaming for data access
5. **Integration Interfaces** - Provide multiple export formats and integration protocols for downstream systems

## Out of Scope

- Machine learning and predictive analytics features
- AI-powered optimization algorithms
- Energy optimization and cost analysis
- Intelligent alerting and anomaly detection
- Performance optimization engines
- User-facing dashboards and visualizations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced data collection system that captures 95%+ of Home Assistant events with full context
2. Data validation framework achieving 99%+ validation success rate with comprehensive error handling
3. Export API system supporting 5+ data formats and 4+ integration protocols for downstream consumption
