# Product Mission

## Pitch

HA-Cleanup is a mobile-first web application that helps Home Assistant users review and analyze historical event data stored in InfluxDB by providing an intuitive interface for identifying issues, anomalies, and inefficiencies in their smart home systems.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Home Assistant Enthusiasts**: Users who have deployed ha-ingestor and want to analyze their historical data
- **Smart Home Troubleshooters**: Users who need to identify patterns and issues in their automation systems

### User Personas

**Smart Home Owner** (30-50 years old)
- **Role:** Home Automation Enthusiast
- **Context:** Has deployed ha-ingestor and wants to understand their smart home performance
- **Pain Points:** Difficulty analyzing historical data, lack of insights into system efficiency, hard to identify automation issues
- **Goals:** Optimize smart home performance, identify and fix automation problems, understand usage patterns

**Home Assistant Administrator** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Technical Home Owner
- **Context:** Manages Home Assistant instance and wants to maintain system health

- **Goals:** Proactive system maintenance, quick problem identification, data-driven optimization

## The Problem

### Data Accessibility Gap

Home Assistant users with ha-ingestor have valuable historical data in InfluxDB but lack simple tools to analyze it. Complex database queries and generic analytics tools create barriers to understanding system performance.

**Our Solution:** A lightweight, mobile-first web interface that transforms raw InfluxDB data into actionable insights.

### Insight Discovery Challenge

Users struggle to identify patterns, anomalies, and inefficiencies in their smart home systems without spending significant time on data analysis and interpretation.

**Our Solution:** Automated suggestion generation with user approval workflows that highlight potential improvements.

### Mobile Experience Deficiency

Existing analytics tools are desktop-focused, limiting users' ability to review and act on insights while away from their computers.

**Our Solution:** Mobile-first design that works seamlessly across all devices and provides quick access to key insights.

## Differentiators

### Lightweight Integration

Unlike complex analytics platforms, we provide a simple, focused tool that integrates seamlessly with existing ha-ingestor deployments. This results in faster setup and easier maintenance.

### Mobile-First Design

Unlike desktop-centric analytics tools, we prioritize mobile usability, enabling users to review insights and approve suggestions from anywhere. This results in higher engagement and faster decision-making.

### Suggestion Workflow

Unlike passive reporting tools, we actively generate actionable suggestions and track user decisions to prevent duplicate recommendations. This results in continuous improvement without repetitive suggestions.
