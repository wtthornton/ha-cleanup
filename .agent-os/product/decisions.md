## 2025-01-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

HA-Cleanup will be developed as a mobile-first web application that provides Home Assistant users with an intuitive interface for analyzing historical event data from their ha-ingestor deployments. The application will focus on identifying issues, anomalies, and inefficiencies while generating actionable suggestions through an approval workflow system.

### Context

Home Assistant users who have deployed ha-ingestor have valuable historical data in InfluxDB but lack simple tools to analyze it. The market opportunity exists for a lightweight, focused analytics tool that integrates seamlessly with existing deployments and prioritizes mobile usability. This addresses the gap between complex analytics platforms and the need for quick, actionable insights in a home environment.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Desktop-First Application**
   - Pros: More screen real estate for complex visualizations, easier development of advanced features
   - Cons: Limits user access, doesn't align with modern usage patterns, harder to use while away from computer

2. **Integrated Module within ha-ingestor**
   - Pros: Single deployment, shared infrastructure, easier data access
   - Cons: Increases complexity of ha-ingestor, harder to maintain separation of concerns, limits independent scaling

3. **Generic Analytics Platform**
   - Pros: More features, established user base, professional support
   - Cons: Overkill for home use, complex setup, expensive, not Home Assistant specific

### Rationale

The mobile-first approach was chosen because:
- Home users need access to insights from anywhere in their home
- Mobile devices are the primary computing platform for most users
- Quick access to suggestions and insights increases user engagement
- Separate deployment allows independent development and maintenance cycles

The focus on simplicity and core functionality was chosen because:
- Home users prefer tools that "just work" without complex configuration
- Rapid iteration and user feedback is more valuable than feature completeness
- Core functionality can be polished and enhanced based on real usage patterns

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time to market with focused MVP
- Better user experience through mobile-first design
- Independent development cycle from ha-ingestor
- Easier deployment and maintenance for home users
- Clear separation of concerns between data ingestion and analysis

**Negative:**
- Requires separate deployment and management
- Limited to read-only access to existing data
- May need to duplicate some infrastructure components
- Requires coordination with ha-ingestor deployment for access
